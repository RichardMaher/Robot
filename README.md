<h1>Robot excersise coding test</h1>
Toy Robot
Instructions
We would like you to write a program that simulates a Toy Robot moving on a table top. The table top is a grid of 5 units x 5 units. There are no obstructions on the table surface. The Toy Robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. A failed or invalid command should not stop the simulation.

Be sure to write comments, a README and any assumptions you made. Provide instructions on how to run the project and any extra notes you may have.
Please use JavaScript, TypeScript or C#.
A basic CLI is more than enough to pass this assessment and secure an interview, but if you're comfortable and want to add a UI, please do.
Testing is great, please show us what you've got!
Every command should provide visual output that the command has either succeeded or failed.
Commit your code to a public Git repository and provide us with the URL.
Commands
Please support the following commands:

PLACE X,Y,F will place the Toy Robot on the table at position X,Y and facing direction F.
Direction can be one of the cardinal points: NORTH, EAST, SOUTH or WEST.
MOVE will move the Toy Robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
LEFT will rotate the Toy Robot 90 degrees left (anti-clockwise/counter-clockwise).
RIGHT will rotate the Toy Robot 90 degrees right (clockwise).
REPORT will announce the X,Y,F of Toy Robot.
